# This data file generated by 23Mofang at: Tue Dec 25 13:18:30 CST 2018
#
# This text file is the raw data that is generated in the 23Mofang Lab from your DNA samples.
# It contains variants like SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) or small Indel (Insertion and Deletion),
# including the data that is not used in the customer report.
#
# This is a tab-delimited text file and its each line corresponds to one genetic marker (SNP and Indel).
# For column one, we provide the SNP identifier where is an rsID or internal id. The column two and three represent
# the chromosome and its basepair position using reference human assembly build 37(GRCh37). The genotype
# on the forward (+) stand is in the last column. It is generated by 23Mofang quality control pipeline
# and some loci will be -- which means we could not determine the genotype at present.
#
# NOTE. SINCE WE WILL IMPROVE THE ABILITY TO CALL GENOTYPE AND THE QUALITY CONTROL PIPELINE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT
# THE DOWNLOADED DATA WILL BE DIFFERENT AT DIFFERENT TIMES. ONCE YOU DOWNLOAD YOUR RAW DATA, YOUR COPY FILE
# WILL NOT BE PROTECTED BY 23MOFANG SECURITY MEASURES AND YOU ASSUME THE RISK OF DATA LEAKAGE.
